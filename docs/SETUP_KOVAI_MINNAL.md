can i# Kovai Minnal (கோவை மின்னல்) – setup from zero to live

This is the same system that runs **Coimbatore 360** (github.com/news360-tn/coimbatore360-autopost), copied as it runs today
(11 Nov 2026) with our name, our images and our own accounts. Nothing in the flow changed: same workflows, same timings, same checks.

Do the steps **in order**. Steps marked **(you)** are yours; the only **(Claude)** step is 7 (I fill the Apps Script copy). Claude never pushes or changes GitHub.
Never paste passwords or API keys into the chat: secret values are typed only into the hidden prompts of `tools/set_secrets.sh`,
`tools/meta_fb_token.sh` or the Apps Script editor.

## What the system does every day (his current setup, unchanged)

| When (IST) | Workflow | What |
|---|---|---|
| 06:00, 10:00, 19:00 | `pick` | Collects Coimbatore news from Dinamalar + Dinamani Coimbatore pages, writes the top **8 + 6 + 6 = 20 news a day** (no e-mail to approve: `PICK_EMAIL: "0"`), makes one AI picture each, saves them in the Sheet and starts posting |
| every 30 min 05:50–21:50 | `powercut` | TNEB power-shutdown notices → reel at once (never twice for the same day + place, never after the cut is over) |
| every 5 min | `post` | Builds the reel (v4 design, Valluvar voice) and posts it to Instagram, plus the top news (max 5 a day, 2 h apart) to Facebook; max 44 a day (6 kept for urgent news) |
| 07:31 | `rasipalan` | Daily rasipalan carousel (calendar design) |
| every 30 min 06:00–23:00 | `comments` | New Instagram comments → 3 reply options e-mailed to you → posted only after you choose |
| 02:10 | `insights` | Reads Instagram insights → learned topic weights (which news gets written first) |

## Accounts you create (all free)

| # | Account | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | New Gmail, e.g. `kovaiminnal.news@gmail.com` | Owns the Sheet, Apps Script, Drive folder, receives reports; also used to sign up for the AI keys and Cloudinary |
| 2 | Instagram `@kovaiminnal` (professional) | The page |
| 3 | Facebook Page "Kovai Minnal" (from your own Facebook profile) | Same reels on Facebook; Instagram is linked to it |
| 4 | Cloudinary (free) | Hosts the reel videos/pictures so Instagram can fetch them |
| 5 | Google AI Studio (Gemini), Groq, Cloudflare, NVIDIA | Free AI for writing and pictures (new keys, never Namenector's) |
| – | Meta app | **No new app**: we reuse your "Namenector Social" app (App ID 1023752790742303) |
| – | GitHub | Your current account **nithiyananthamQA**, public repository `kovaiminnal-autopost` (public = unlimited free Actions minutes) |

## 1. Brand kit (images and texts)

All images are made by `python3 tools/make_brand.py` (our own drawings, nothing from Coimbatore 360): Coimbatore at dusk –
Adiyogi (Isha), a textile-mill chimney, the Ukkadam lakefront, coconut palms and one lightning bolt (மின்னல்).

| File | Size / format | Where it goes |
|---|---|---|
| `brand/profile_1080.png` | 1080 x 1080 PNG, round | **You upload:** Instagram profile picture **and** Facebook Page profile picture (same file) |
| `brand/fb_cover_1640x624.png` | 1640 x 624 PNG | **You upload:** Facebook Page cover photo (desktop shows 820 x 312; mobile crops the sides – the name stays in the middle) |
| `kit/logo_coimbatore.png` | 1092 x 1092 PNG, transparent | **Used by the system** (same file name as his): round logo top-right in every reel, carousels, daily rasipalan |
| `reel/assets/footer_coimbatore.png` | 2172 x 724 PNG, transparent | **Used by the system:** name strip at the bottom of every reel, with the same round logo (approved 11 Nov) |

## 2. Instagram account (you)

1. On the phone, Instagram → add account → **Create new account** with the new Gmail. Username **`kovaiminnal`** (if taken: `kovai.minnal`, `kovaiminnal_news` – tell me which one you got).
2. Profile picture: `brand/profile_1080.png`. Name, bio: from section 1.
3. Settings → **Account type and tools → Switch to professional account → Business** → category **News & Media Website** → contact options: skip.
4. Settings → Privacy: account **public**; Comments: allow from everyone; Mentions: everyone.
5. Post nothing by hand yet (the first post comes from the system).

## 3. Facebook Page (you)

1. facebook.com (your own profile) → Pages → **Create new Page**. Name: from section 1. Category: **News & media website**. Bio: from section 1.
2. Profile picture `brand/profile_1080.png`, cover `brand/fb_cover_1640x624.png`.
3. Page → Settings → **Linked accounts → Instagram → Connect** → log in to `@kovaiminnal`.
4. Page → Settings → Page setup → **Page access**: you must have full control (needed for the token in step 8).

## 4. Google side (you, logged in as the NEW Gmail)

1. **Sheet**: sheets.new → name it `Kovai Minnal Log` → rename the first tab to **`News`** → paste this header into row 1 (A1, one cell per word – paste as one line, then Data → Split text to columns → separator: comma):

   ```
   story_id,researched,published,headline_ta,headline_en,category,location,importance,verification,source,other_sources,review_page,doc,notion,caption,email_sent,gmail_id,review,post_to,reel,reel_script,slides_spec,post_status,posted_at,spare_link,coimbatore_link,reel_link,notes,batch,prompts,images
   ```
   (31 columns, A … AE. The other tabs – All News, Pick, Comments – are created by the script itself.)
   Copy the Sheet id from the address bar: `docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/`**`THIS_PART`**`/edit`.
2. **Drive folder**: drive.google.com → New folder `Kovai Minnal` → open it → copy the id from the address bar: `drive.google.com/drive/folders/`**`THIS_PART`**.

## 5. Cloudinary (you)

1. cloudinary.com → sign up free with the new Gmail. Dashboard → copy the **Cloud name**.
2. Settings (gear) → **Upload → Upload presets → Add upload preset** → Name `kovaiminnal`, **Signing mode: Unsigned**, Folder `kovaiminnal` → Save.

## 6. Keys – paste them into ONE file: `/home/nathi/coimbatore insta/.env` (never pushed; only you see it)

Already filled: `GEMINI_API_KEY` (from Namenector, free – its Google project must have **no billing**), `NVIDIA_API_KEY`,
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (FashionFreelancing Cloudflare account), `CLOUDINARY_PRESET=kovaiminnal`.

You paste (open the file in any editor, put the value after `=`):

| Line in .env | Where you get it | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `GROQ_API_KEY=` | your existing Groq key | free |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=` | dash.cloudflare.com (FashionFreelancing login) → My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token → template **"Workers AI"** → Create → copy | free (~230 pictures/day) |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD=` | step 5 | free |
| `BRIDGE_URL=` and `BRIDGE_KEY=` | step 8 | free |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` (optional) | console.anthropic.com → API keys (prepaid credits) – backup writer, ~₹20/day | paid, optional |
| `FAL_KEY=` (optional) | fal.ai → API keys (prepaid) – pictures after Cloudflare's free daily allowance | paid, optional |

Then step 10.3 copies everything from `.env` to GitHub in one command.

## 7. Send me (Claude) these 5 values – not secret, but keep them out of public places

`SHEET_ID`, `ROOT_FOLDER_ID`, the new Gmail (`OWNER_EMAIL`), Cloudinary `CLOUD_NAME`, upload preset name (`kovaiminnal`).
**(Claude)** I write them into `apps_script/Code.local.gs` (a copy that is never pushed to GitHub).

## 8. Apps Script bridge (you, NEW Gmail)

1. script.google.com → **New project** → name `Kovai Minnal bridge` → delete the sample → paste the whole `apps_script/Code.local.gs` → Save.
2. Run (top bar) the function **`setup`** → allow every permission Google asks (Gmail, Sheets, Drive). It creates `BRIDGE_KEY`, the Voice folder, a 5-minute mail trigger and the weekly Instagram token refresh.
3. Run **`authorizeForms`** once → allow (needed by the pick / comment pages).
4. **Deploy → New deployment → type Web app** → Execute as: **Me** → Who has access: **Anyone** → Deploy → copy the **Web app URL** (this is `BRIDGE_URL`).
5. Project Settings (gear) → **Script properties**: copy the value of `BRIDGE_KEY` (for step 10). Add the property `IG_TOKEN_COIMBATORE` in step 9.

After every later change to `Code.gs`: paste the new `Code.local.gs`, run `setup` again, Deploy → Manage deployments → pencil → Version: **New version** → Deploy (the URL stays the same).

## 9. Meta tokens (you, with the "Namenector Social" app)

**Instagram token (goes into the Apps Script, like his):**
1. developers.facebook.com → My Apps → **Namenector Social** → Use cases → **Add use case → "Manage messaging & content on Instagram"** (Instagram API with Instagram login) – skip if it is already there.
2. That use case → **API setup with Instagram login → 2. Generate access tokens → Add account** → log in as `@kovaiminnal` → allow.
   If Instagram asks to accept a tester invite: Instagram app → Settings → Website permissions → Apps and websites → Tester invites → Accept, then Add account again.
3. Permissions needed: `instagram_business_basic`, `instagram_business_content_publish`, `instagram_business_manage_comments`, `instagram_business_manage_insights`.
4. **Generate token** → copy → Apps Script → Project Settings → Script properties → **Add** `IG_TOKEN_COIMBATORE` = the token → Save. (The script refreshes it every Sunday.)

**Facebook Page token (goes into GitHub secrets):**
1. developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer → Meta App: **Namenector Social** → User or Page: **Get User Access Token** → permissions `pages_show_list`, `pages_read_engagement`, `pages_manage_posts` (+ `business_management` if the Page sits in a business portfolio) → Generate → tick **only the Kovai Minnal Page** → **Copy token**.
2. **After the repo exists (step 10.1)**, in this folder: `bash tools/meta_fb_token.sh` → paste the token (hidden). It saves `FB_PAGE_ID_COIMBATORE` and `FB_TOKEN_COIMBATORE` to the repository (it refuses the Namenector page and never touches Namenector's secrets).

## 10. GitHub (you – Claude never pushes)

1. **Create the public repo and push** (in this folder, in the Claude prompt type `!` first, or in any terminal):
   ```
   cd "/home/nathi/coimbatore insta"
   gh repo create nithiyananthamQA/kovaiminnal-autopost --public --source . --remote origin --push
   ```
2. **Right away, switch off every scheduled workflow** (nothing may run before go-live):
   ```
   for w in post.yml pick.yml powercut.yml rasipalan.yml comments.yml insights.yml; do gh workflow disable "$w" -R nithiyananthamQA/kovaiminnal-autopost; done
   ```
   Why: his `PAUSED` variable is read by no code, and the `LIVE` file only stops the 5-minute scheduled posting – pick, powercut and
   rasipalan post on their own schedule. A disabled workflow never runs.
3. **Secrets:** `bash tools/set_secrets.sh` – copies every key from `.env` to the repository's secrets (asks only for an empty required one).
4. **Facebook secrets:** `bash tools/meta_fb_token.sh` (step 9, Facebook part).
5. Repository → Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions: **Read and write** (the bot commits its state).

## 11. Test – nothing is posted (you run, from GitHub → Actions → workflow → Run workflow)

1. **tests** – 335 tests must pass.
2. **ig-probe** – reads the Instagram account with the token (no post).
3. **Facebook check** – shows which Facebook page the secrets point to.
4. **pick** → `dry = 1` – collects today's Coimbatore news and shows the list (nothing written or posted).
5. **powercut** → `dry = 1`.
6. **Post stories** → `dry_run` – builds a reel without posting; download it from the run's artifacts and check it.
   A disabled workflow cannot be run by hand either: `gh workflow enable <file> -R nithiyananthamQA/kovaiminnal-autopost`, run the
   test, then `gh workflow disable <file> -R ...` again (tests, ig-probe and Facebook check have no schedule – they never need it).

## 12. Go live (you)

1. Add the `LIVE` file and push:
   ```
   cd "/home/nathi/coimbatore insta" && echo "$(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC') - Kovai Minnal live" > LIVE && git add LIVE && git commit -m "Go live" && git push
   ```
2. Actions → **collect-switch → start** (writes `research_free/ENABLED` and `START_AT` = now, exactly like his).
3. Switch the scheduled workflows on:
   ```
   for w in post.yml pick.yml powercut.yml rasipalan.yml comments.yml insights.yml; do gh workflow enable "$w" -R nithiyananthamQA/kovaiminnal-autopost; done
   ```
4. First posts come at the next 06:00 / 10:00 / 19:00 pick or the next power-cut notice.

**Stop everything at once:** run the step-10.2 `disable` line again. Deleting `LIVE` stops only the 5-minute scheduled posting.

## Cost

₹0: public GitHub repo (free Actions minutes), free Gemini (no billing on its project), Groq, Cloudflare (10,000 neurons a day), NVIDIA credits,
Cloudinary free plan, edge-tts Valluvar voice. Only `FAL_KEY` would cost money, and it is left empty.
